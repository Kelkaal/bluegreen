 Blue/Green Deployment Alert Runbook
=====================================

##  What These Alerts Mean & What To Do

### "Failover Detected" Alert
**What Happened:**
The system automatically switched traffic from one color to another (like from Blue to Green).

**Why This Happens:**
- One of your application pools stopped working
- The load balancer detected issues and switched to the backup pool
- This is the system protecting itself!

**What To Check First:**
```bash
# See which containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check the logs of the pool that failed
docker-compose logs app_blue --tail=20
docker-compose logs app_green --tail=20
Quick Fixes:

Restart the broken pool: docker-compose restart app_blue (or app_green)

Check if it's back: curl -H "X-App-Pool: blue" http://localhost:8080/

The system will automatically switch back when healthy

"High Error Rate" Alert
=======================
What Happened:
More than 2% of recent requests are failing with server errors.

Why This Matters:

Users are seeing error pages instead of your app

This could mean your app is struggling or a dependency is down

What To Check:
==============

bash
# See recent errors in nginx
docker-compose logs nginx --tail=10 | grep "50x"

# Check both app logs for clues
docker-compose logs app_blue app_green --tail=15
Quick Actions:

Check if it's a temporary spike (wait 2 minutes)

If errors continue, restart the problematic pool

Monitor if error rate drops below 2%

Planned Maintenance
===================
To temporarily stop alerts during updates:

bash
# Turn off alerting
docker-compose stop alert_watcher

# Do your maintenance work...

# Turn alerting back on
docker-compose start alert_watcher
